.TH qmail-rspawn 8
.SH NAME
qmail-rspawn \- schedule remote deliveries
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-rspawn
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qmail-rspawn
reads a series of remote delivery commands from descriptor 0,
invokes
.B qmail-remote
to perform the deliveries,
and prints the results to descriptor 1. If the environment variable QMAILREMOTE
is defined, the executable defined by QMAILREMOTE is invoked instead.

.B qmail-rspawn
invokes
.B qmail-remote
asynchronously,
so the results may not be in the same order as the commands.

qmail-remote(8)
